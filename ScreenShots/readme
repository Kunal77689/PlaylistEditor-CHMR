I created a software for the CHMR MUN RADIO STATION by using Java and MySQL.
I couldn't add the code because I don't have any permissions from the employer currently. 
But I can ask for the permissions if needed. There are screen captures of the functioning of the software. 
This software basically gets all the data entered by the user and displays it in a vertical column as soon as it is entered.
User can either delete or add more data to it.
At the end if you click on finalize, a pdf copy will be created of the playlist you made and it will get saved on a server(location specified)
